  <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
  <img src = "pictures-1000_381.jpg">
  
  <p>
    The CSS box model is important to understand how to layout web pages. The CSS box model consists of Margin, Border, Padding, and Content.
    A diagram and more information can be found at <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_boxmodel.asp" target = "_blank"> here, at W3Schools.</a>
  </p>

  <p> I think of the CSS box model like a wall decorated with pictures. Each picture is an HTML element. 
    Some of the pictures have frames. Some are just canvases. Some picures have mats inside the frame 
    while others have only the frame. The wall is the browser window. The spaces between the pictures are the margins. 
    The picture is the content. The frame is the border. The mat is the padding between the content and the frame.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Below is two exapmples of the box model. The Margin is the invisible space outside of the box between Html elements. The border, in this example, is Indigo. 
    The border is the area around the padding and the content. The padding is transparent and it is the area around the content. 
    The content of the box can hold text or images.
  </p>

  <div>
    <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>   
    <br> width: 225px
    <br> border: 15px solid indigo
    <br> padding: 50px
    <br> margin: 50px
  </div>

  <div class = "divCss3">
   <h2>CSS3 Box Model box-sizing Property</h2>
   <br> width: 225px
   <br> border: 15px solid indigo
   <br> padding: 50px
   <br> margin: 50px
   <br>box-sizing: border-box
  </div>
  
  <p>
    The total width for the first box above is 355 pixels.  It is calculated by multiplying the border, padding, and margin by 2 for the right and left sides.
    Then adding the sum of the multiplied border, padding, and margin with the width equals the total width of the box model.
  </p>
  
  <p> The second box is using the same properties except that is using CSS3 box sizing: border-box.
    The box-sizing property allows for easier calculations of the width of the element, which is set by the width property. 
    The width of the second box is 225 px. The padding and the border are included in the elements total width and height.
  </p>

  <p> Also back to our pictures on the wall example, you'll notice that the blank space between the two boxes as well as the space 
      between the text and the left side of the browser window is 50 pixels which is set by the margin property</p>
  
  <p>In reality everything on this page is a part of the CSS Box Model. The picture the text all have these properties. I just set all visible properties 
    on the two boxes by using two html div elements. These are just the basics of the CSS box model and much more can be done.
