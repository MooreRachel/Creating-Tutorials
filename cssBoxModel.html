  <p>Margin, border, padding, and content is the order of the CSS Box Model. It works from
    the outside of the box towards the content. The Margin is the space outside
    of the box and it is transparent. The border, in this example, is Indigo.
    The border is the  area around the padding and the content. The padding is
    transparent and it is the area around the content. The content of the box
    can hold text or images.

<div>
<h2>CSS Box Model</h2>


<br> width: 200px
<br> border: 10px solid indigo
<br> padding: 10px
<br> margin: 50px

   </p>

 </div>
 <p>
   The total width for the box above is 340 pixels.  It is calculated by multiplying the border,
   padding, and margin by 2 for the right and left sides.
   Then adding the sum of the multiplied border, padding, and margin
   with the width equals the total width of the box model.

 <div class = "divCss3">
   <h2>CSS3 Box Model box-sizing Property</h2>

   <br> width: 200px
   <br> border: 10px solid indigo
   <br> padding: 10px
   <br> margin: 50px
   <br>box-sizing: border-box
</div>
<p> As you can see all the properties in the second box are the same except
   for the box-sizing property that is because the box-sizing property allows
   us to include the padding and the border in an elements total width and height.

<p> Also you will notice that both boxes are fixed and not responsive. If you
  adjust your browser window the paragraph text resizes however the size of the boxes remain unchanged.

  <p> So with CSS3 keep in mind that the calculations for the box model is different
    when using the CSS3 box-sizing property. How would you make the second box
    the same size as the first box when using the box-sizing property?
